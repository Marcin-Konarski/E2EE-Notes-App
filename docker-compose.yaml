# Mouting a volume ./frontend:/app overwrites everything in app, including /app/node_modules which causes werid issue caused by copied node_modules and package-lock.json
# By mounting a named volume at /app/node_modules we "protect" that folder from being overwritten in container by host
#Also .dockerignore requires those `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` to ensure they are not copied to the container but freshly installed
# Now, node_modules is built and used inside the container, with the correct Linux binaries
# Thanks to this solution code is hot-reloaded from host and dependencies are always correct for the container and nothing breaks
